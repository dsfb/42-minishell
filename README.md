# 42-minishell

## Overview
Minishell is a custom shell program written in C, designed to mimic some basic functionalities of [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)), the Bourne Again SHell. This project is part of the 42 School curriculum, aimed at deepening our understanding of system processes, file descriptors, and the intricacies of command-line interfaces. By creating our own shell, we delve into the core of Unix-based systems, learning to control processes, interpret user commands, and manage environmental variables.






## Team Development Steps for Minishell
### Step 1: Initial Planning and Setup
- **Repository Setup**: Collaboratively set up the GitHub repository, ensuring a clear directory structure and branch strategy.
- **Makefile Creation**: Makefile that includes rules for `all`, `clean`, `fclean`, `re`
- Set up libft libray

### Step 3: Parsing and Input Management

#### Command Reading:
Implemented readline and integrated add_history

[GNU Readline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Readline)
```bash
brew install readline
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <readline/readline.h>
#include <readline/history.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *input;

    while (1)
    {
        input = readline("minishell$ ");
        if (!input)
            break;
        if (*input)
            add_history(input);
        printf("Input: %s\n", input);
        free(input);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
